# Fluence ETHDenver 2023 Hackathon

Welcome to what will undoubtedly amount  to yet another awesome EthDenver event. Fluence Labs' 2023 hackathon is all about keeping your dApps decentralized with decentralized RPC. To this end, Fluence is offering a total of USDC 11,000 in bounties.

## About Fluence

Fluence is a decentralized serverless platform & computing marketplace powered by blockchain economics. Fluence is a global, permissionless, scalable, and secure alternative to centralized cloud computing platforms.

Using Fluence, developers can build and deploy natively decentralized applications to a network of compute providers where providers range from professional data centers to home computers. Providers compete on price and performance and constantly prove that they serve applications to earn rewards.

Fluence is powered by a cryptographic token which serves as both collateral for provider participation and as a monetary incentive. Providers earn both the Fluence token and payment origin (usually stablecoin) for serving applications.

## Hacking On Fluence

Running blockchain nodes to support your dApps tends to be unreasonably resource intensive and not surprisingly, Web3 developers tend to gravitate toward using hosted blockchain gateways, aka RPC, solutions. Alas, "RPC as SaaS" introduces centralized bottlenecks challenging the availability, reliability and ethos of dApps.

With the Fluence's decentralized FaaS stack, which is comprised of an open, permissionless p2p network and supporting open source tooling, developers can easily create decentralized RPC solutions for their dApps.

## Bounties

For the hackathon, Fluence is providing RPC starter code called [fRPC](./fRPC-Starter) that is ready to use in your dApps.

### Use fRPC to connect your dApp to Blockchain -- 5 x USDC 1,000.00

Use the [fRPC-Starter](https://github.com/fluencelabs/fRPC-Substrate) code in your dAPP instead of using one centralized RPC SaaS and submit your repo, a dockerized demo of your dAPP and a 60 to 90 second video how fRPC has helped your dAPP stay decentralized.


For the purpose of this bounty, a dApp has to have a backend, i.e., deployed (testnet) contract(s), and perform meaningful work. That is, submissions simply enumerating and exercising some or all of the fRPC methods are not eligible for a reward. In case of more than five eligible submissions, both the extensiveness of the use of fRPC in your dApp and timestamp of submission are additional judging criteria.

### Improve fRPC -- USDC 3,000, 2,000, 1,000

Improve the [fRPC Starter](./fRPC-Starter/) substrate to make it more general, robust or performant. Improvements which may include

* expanding the available set of blockchain API providers, i.e., Infura, Alchemy, and Link
* creating an fRPC "balancer" for real-time blockchain API provider selection according to discriminators such as geo-location, reputation or availability
* adding additional RPC methods to accommodate specific or custom EVM implementations
* supporting different API key submissions mechanisms such as a string in the request header 

Prices of USDC 3,000, USDC 2,000 and USDC 1,000 are available for best three submissions. Please fork [fRPC Starter](./fRPC-Starter/), generously document your solution, provide a dockerized demo of your solution and provide a three to five minute video shilling your masterpiece.
